      # or via the `--env/-e` CLI option; an example usage of the latter being:

      # $ docker compose up -e DOCS_PORT=1234

      # Note: This will overwrite any `/nmdc-schema` directory that might have been created
      #       while building the container (i.e. while processing the `Dockerfile`).
