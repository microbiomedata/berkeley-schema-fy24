notes:
  - commented out several MIxS terms/slots that were sharing slot uris
  - note that the NMDC submission schema in sheets_and_friends takes its MIxS terms from
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/main/model/schema/mixs.yaml
    and then potentially modifies them. Ideally this file would contain MIxS terms, essentially ready-to-use
  - yet another source of MIxS terms is the incomplete https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/tree/issue-511-tested-schemasheets
