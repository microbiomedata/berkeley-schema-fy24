1. Learn about the NERSC sshproxy app, which generates 24-hour password-less keys:  https://www.nersc.gov/assets/Uploads/Using-sshproxy.pdf
2. Download the NERSC's `sshproxy` app with the `scp` command on page 5 of the PDF. One caveat: the documentation recommends getting the app from `cori.nersc.gov`, which has been retired. So use `perlmutter.nersc.gov` or  `dtn01.nersc.gov`.
3. Create a NERSC ssh key with the `sshproxy` command that was just downloaded. Use the `-u` option unless your NERSC username is identical to your local username. For examples, my local username is "XYZ" but my NERSC username is "xyz", so I enter `.sshproxy -u xyz`
1. create an ssh tunnel from your local computer, though `dtn01.nersc.gov` to the (production) MongoDB on mongo-loadbalancer.nmdc.production. Note that zI am recommending tunneling the MongoDB port to local port 27777. Other NMDC poeple may recommend other ports. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/nersc -L27777:mongo-loadbalancer.nmdc.production.svc.spin.nersc.org:27017 -o ServerAliveInterval=60 <NERSC USERNAME>@dtn01.nersc.gov`
