- name: ecosystem
  description: An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic factors)
    and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment. Ecosystem
    is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
  comments:
  - The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms
    in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification
    system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism or
    environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem are
    Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected
    from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments
    like bioreactors respectively.

- name: ecosystem_category
  description: Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
    on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
    is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
  comments:
  - The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic and Terrestrial.
    Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual hosts or phyla
    and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments like bioreactors,
    solid waste etc.

  description: Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
    the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still broad
    but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem type is
    in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
  comments:
  - The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types like Marine
    or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air or Outdoor
    air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated samples, ecosystem
    type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system, Roots etc.

  description: Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types
    into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD path.
  comments:
  - Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further divided
    (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone etc. in
    the Ecosystem subtype category.

  comments:
  - Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
    of an environment under the five-level classification system.
