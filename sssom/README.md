# SSSOM Mappings
This directory holds [SSSOM](https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM) files used to define mappings.

Some recently added files are per-sample mappings and not actually in the SSSOM format. Might require moving to a better location.
- per_biosample_scoped_ebs_mapping_results.tsv
    - This file accounts for the fact that biosamples can be annotated with a pipe-delimited list of terms in MIxS triad columns like `env_broad_scale`
